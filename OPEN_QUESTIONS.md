## Q1. Backend HC stage-constant fix + historical backfill

`routers/health_connect.py` stage constants are confirmed wrong (DECISIONS_LOG #20):
`SLEEP_STAGE_DEEP=4`, `REM=5`, `LIGHT=2`. Correct to the official enum — `LIGHT=4`,
`DEEP=5`, `REM=6`, `AWAKE=1` — and add handling for stage 6 (currently dropped) so
REM is counted. Then decide whether to **backfill** the corrupted `health_connect_syncs`
rows or let them age out: the HC path looks dormant (latest row 2026-06-21, all written
in a single backfill at 2026-06-21 19:04Z; live sleep stages currently come from the
scraper). Also re-verify the HC `sleep_score` derivation and the `_section_health_connect`
AI-prompt block, which both consume the mislabelled values.

**Status:** resolved → #20. Fix deployed to Railway (PR #2) and all 31 HC rows
re-synced from device on 2026-06-22 (30-day backfill, range 05-22→06-21). Verified
against Railway Postgres: `light_sleep_minutes` now populated (was 0 on every row),
deep/REM no longer swapped, slivers no longer truncated; corrected values track the
scraper. Surfaced a new date-attribution bug — see Q4.

## Q2. Companion `validateNight` returns overlapping/duplicate SleepSession records

`validateNight()` for last night returned `sleepRecords: 4` with the per-stage `durMin`
arrays clearly doubled (totals ≈2× the real night: stage-5 deep 69→~34.5, stage-6 rem
134→67). `runDeepConfidence`/`flagDeepSegments` currently `flatMap` all sessions and will
double-count. Must de-duplicate before `trustedDeepMin` is meaningful — e.g. pick the
longest session per night (as `health_connect.py:_aggregate_day` does), or union by time
range. Until then `runDeepConfidence` output is not trustworthy.

**Status:** open

## Q3. HR sampling cadence during sleep unconfirmed (`hrMedianGapSec = 0`)

Gate 3 returned `hrMedianGapSec: 0` over 802 samples, not the expected ~60s (1/min). Caused
by duplicate HR timestamps from the same record-doubling as Q2. The artifact flagging depends
on real HR density during sleep, so this must be re-measured after HR is de-duped. Gate 3 is
INCONCLUSIVE — do **not** calibrate `DELTA_ARTIFACT` / `SPREAD_SPIKE` / `SHORT_MS` or wire
`runDeepConfidence` into readiness/Banister until resolved.

**Status:** open

## Q4. HC dates each night one day earlier than the scraper

After the Q1 backfill, corrected HC stage minutes match the scraper but under a consistent
one-day shift: `health_connect_syncs[date] ≈ samsung_hrv_readings[date+1]` (3 nights match
all three stages exactly, the rest within 1–2 min; 0 same-date matches). `_aggregate_day`
attributes a session by its bed-date while the scraper keys on the wake-date. This
pre-existed the Q1 fix — it was invisible while the HC values were garbage. It matters
because `_section_health_connect` selects "today/yesterday" and the dashboard joins by
date, so HC and scraper rows for the *same physical night* land on different days. Decide a
single canonical sleep-date convention (likely wake-date, to match the scraper) and align
`_aggregate_day`.

**Status:** open

_Gate summary (2026-06-22, on-device, SM-S921B): GATE 1 PASS → DECISIONS_LOG #20.
GATE 2 PASS (deep slivers survive the HC write at 30s resolution; deep is heavily
fragmented — ~26 of 30 deep segments are <3 min slivers). GATE 3 INCONCLUSIVE → Q3._
